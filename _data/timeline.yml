  description: During the summer of 2022, I had an unforgettable experience as a wilderness retreat counselor at a camp, where I had the privilege of guiding and inspiring young campers through various outdoor activities and team-building exercises. My time as a counselor not only honed my leadership skills but also strengthened my ability to foster a positive and enriching environment, leaving a lasting impact on both campers and myself.
